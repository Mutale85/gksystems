This project is a 7 tier
- Orphanage
- Real Estate
- Transport & Logistics
- Media
- Hospitals
- Academics
- Farms

The purpose of this app is to help me manage my business more efficiently by providing a 
platform for communication and problem-solving between myself, my workers, and my clients.
 
The app should be easy to use and should allow different users to access 
only the information that is relevant to their role. For example, 
someone working for an orphanage should only be able to access features 
related to orphanages, while someone working in real estate should 
only be able to access features related to real estate.
 
The app should have the following features:
 
- The ability to track maintenance issues for properties and vehicles, 
such as broken windows or flat tires, and notify me when these issues arise.
- A platform for tenants to report problems with their rental units, 
such as a leaky faucet or faulty electrical outlet, and receive assistance from me or my workers.
- A system for managing payments and notifying tenants when their rent is due.
- A private and secure platform accessible only to me, my workers, and my clients, 
with different levels of password authentication for different types of users.

The app should cover the following areas of my business: orphanages, real estate, transport and logistics, farms, media, hospitals, and academics.
